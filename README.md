# HairAppartement SPA

Developed with React + TypeScript + Vite

## Run the project locally

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deploy the project to gh pages manually

```

Known issue:
After a successfull deploy the domain no longer points to `www.hairappartement.de`,
this needs to be done manually atm

## Facing issues? Try updating node
